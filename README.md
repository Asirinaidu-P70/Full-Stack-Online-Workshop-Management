Simple Node + Express backend with a static frontend.

Quick start:

```powershell
npm install
npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

- API endpoints are under `/api`
- The frontend lives in `public/index.html`

Notes:
- This is an in-memory demo (no database). Restarting the server resets data.
- To develop with automatic restarts, install `nodemon` and run `npm run dev`.
